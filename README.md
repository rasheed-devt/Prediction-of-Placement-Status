# Prediction-of-Placement-Status

# Overview

The **Prediction of Placement Status** project is a data analysis and predictive modeling project aimed at predicting whether students will be placed in a job or not based on various factors. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for using it, and details about the dataset.

# Files in this Repository

1. **Prediction of Placement Status.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for data analysis, modeling, and predictions. It's the heart of the project where you can see how the data is explored, models are trained, and predictions are made.

1. **Prediction of Placement Status.xlsx:** This Excel file likely contains the cleaned and preprocessed data used for analysis and modeling. It might have multiple sheets, including one for training data and possibly another for testing data.

1. **Train Data.xlsx:** This Excel file is likely a subset of the main dataset containing only the training data used to train and validate machine learning models.

1. **Test Data.xlsx:** This Excel file likely contains data used for testing the trained models. It's often used to assess the model's predictive performance on unseen data.

# How to Use

To use this project:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Prediction-of-Placement-Status.git`

1. **Explore the Jupyter Notebook:** Open and run the Jupyter Notebook **(Prediction of Placement Status.ipynb)** to explore the data, see how the models are trained, and make predictions. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.

1. **Review the Data:** Examine the provided Excel files **(Prediction of Placement Status.xlsx, Train Data.xlsx, and Test Data.xlsx)** to understand the structure and content of the dataset.

1. **Modify and Extend:** You can modify the Jupyter Notebook to experiment with different machine learning algorithms, feature engineering, or data visualization techniques to improve the prediction accuracy.

# Dataset Information

The dataset **(Prediction of Placement Status.xlsx)** likely contains information about students and various features related to their placement status. Common columns might include:

* First Name
* Email ID
* Ticket Type
* Attendee #
* Attendee Status
* College Name
* Designation
* Year of Graduation
* CGPA
* Speaking Skills
* ML Knowledge
* Placement Status (Target Variable: Placed/Not Placed)

Ensure that you understand the meaning of each column in the dataset before working with it.
